evaluate_window(window, piece): This function evaluates the potential of a given window (which is a list of four consecutive cells in a row, column, or diagonal) for a specific player's piece. It calculates a score based on the number of pieces of that player and the opponent in the window. The score is calculated as follows:
If the window contains four pieces of the player's color, the score is 100.
If the window contains three pieces of the player's color and one empty cell, the score is 5.
If the window contains two pieces of the player's color and two empty cells, the score is 2.
If the window contains three pieces of the opponent's color and one empty cell, the score is -4.

score_position(board, piece): This function calculates the overall score of a given board state for a specific player's piece. It does this by summing up the scores of all possible windows in the board. The score is calculated as follows:
It scores the center column of the board higher, as having pieces in the center is generally advantageous.
It scores horizontal, vertical, and diagonal windows of four cells, using the evaluate_window function to calculate the score for each window.
It also scores positively sloped and negatively sloped diagonal windows of four cells.
In summary, the evaluate_window function calculates the potential of a specific window for a player, while the score_position function calculates the overall score of a board state for a player by summing up the scores of all possible windows.
